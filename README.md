# Project Name
> Outline a brief description of your project.
  You are required to model the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the 
  demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
  Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.

## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  A US bike-sharing provider `BoomBikes` has a daily dataset on the rental bikes based on various environmental and seasonal settings. It wishes to use this data to 
  understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market and come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its 
  revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown due to corona pandemic comes to an end.
  
- What is the background of your project?
  Finding the decision variables with the given datasets for demadn of the bike share in the US States.
  
- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
  Need to create a model to the demand for shared bikes with the available independent variables. It will be used by the management to understand how exactly the 
  demands vary with different features. They can accordingly manipulate the business strategy to meet the demand levels and meet the customer's expectations. 
  Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the demand dynamics of a new market.
  
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  The file name of the dataset is 'day.csv' which has independent variables and a dependent variable.

## Conclusions
- Conclusion 1 from the analysis
  From the ‘Season’ box plot we can say that more bikes are given rent during the Fall season.
  
- Conclusion 2 from the analysis
  The ‘Year’ box plot represents that most of the bikes are rented during 2019 where the x variable has values ‘0’ and ‘1’s which indicated 
  yr : year (0: 2018, 1:2019) as per Data Dictionary.
  
- Conclusion 3 from the analysis
  ‘Month’ box plot represents Most of the bikes given rent in September month and in January very few bikes are given comparatively.

- Conclusion 4 from the analysis
  From the ‘Holiday’ and ‘Working day’ box plots, we can see that most of the customers are opting for bike rentals on working days than on weekend days may be 
  due to high floating rates
